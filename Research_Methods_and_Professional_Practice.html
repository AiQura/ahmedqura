						<h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing</h3>
					</header>
					
						<P>The advent of agent-based systems in artificial intelligence (AI) owes much to key
							advancements and the distinct benefits these systems bring to organizations. A major
							driver is the increasing complexity of problems demanding sophisticated and adaptable
							solutions. Traditional centralized systems often falter with scalability and
							flexibility, while agent-based systems, comprised of autonomous agents interacting
							within a given environment, offer a more resilient framework for tackling complex tasks
							(Wooldridge, 2009).</p>

						These systems shine in distributed problem-solving, essential for organizations
						operating in dynamic and unpredictable settings. Take supply chain management, for
						instance. Here, agent-based systems efficiently oversee and optimize logistics by
						allowing individual agents to represent various entities like suppliers, manufacturers,
						and distributors. These agents can negotiate and coordinate among themselves to improve
						overall system performance (Parunak, 1999).</p>

						Moreover, agent-based modeling enhances the ability to simulate real-world scenarios.
						Organizations can create simulations that mirror the interactions of agents within a
						system, providing valuable insights into potential outcomes and supporting better
						decision-making. This is particularly advantageous in fields such as finance,
						healthcare, and urban planning, where understanding the interplay of different factors
						is crucial for effective strategy development (Bonabeau, 2002).</p>

						In essence, the rise of agent-based systems is propelled by their capacity to manage
						complexity, enable distributed problem-solving, and offer robust simulation
						capabilities. These strengths empower organizations to operate more efficiently and make
						well-informed decisions in an increasingly intricate and interconnected world.</p>

								<h3>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h3>
							</header> 
							<p>
							When used correctly, surveys can be a valuable tool for gathering insights. However, if they’re mishandled, the consequences can be serious — from ethical dilemmas to legal issues and broken social trust. We've all seen high-profile cases like Cambridge Analytica, but it's not just them. Many examples show how privacy can be violated and trust damaged when surveys are misused. 

Take the Target pregnancy prediction case from 2012 as an example. Target was using shopping data and surveys to predict the pregnancy status of customers (Duhigg, 2012). By analyzing shopping patterns, they developed a “pregnancy prediction score” for their female customers. The problem came when these predictions led to targeted ads for baby products being sent to unsuspecting customers—including a teenage girl whose father had no idea she was pregnant. This situation raised real concerns about privacy and the ethics behind using personal data in this way.

Another instance was in 2016, when researchers from Aarhus University released a dataset with personal information from around 70,000 OKCupid users. The dataset included responses to some deeply personal survey questions about things like sexual preferences and drug use (Zimmer, 2018). Despite their academic intentions, the researchers failed to get proper consent and didn’t anonymize the data, exposing users to significant risks and violating ethical standards.

The impacts of cases like these are multi-dimensional:

Ethical Violations: Both cases demonstrate breaches in informed consent. Users had no idea that their survey data and purchasing habits would be used in ways that could personally affect them or expose sensitive details (Resnik, 2018).

Social Trust: Misuse like this breeds public distrust in organizations, making people less likely to share personal information or participate in surveys, which is a blow to legitimate data collection efforts (Rainie and Anderson, 2017).

Legal Ramifications: These practices could also breach laws like the GDPR 
in the EU, which requires clear consent and tight control over data use (European Commission, 2016).

Professional Standards: Organizations and researchers involved often 
suffer reputational damage, emphasizing how critical it is to follow ethical 
and professional guidelines in handling data (Professional Standards Authority, 2018).

These cases make it clear: transparency, ethics, and legal compliance 
are non-negotiable when it comes to handling survey data. Without them, 
trust is lost. And that’s something that’s hard to win back.

								<h3>Unit 6 :</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I worked on basic stats like calculating the sample size,
								 mean, median, and standard deviation using Excel. 
								 I practiced these with datasets, such as weight loss data 
								 from two diets (Diet A and Diet B). This helped me see how 
								 the two diets compared by looking at the average weight loss 
								 and how spread out the results were.
								I also got into analyzing brand preferences by counting how 
								many times different brands were chosen in various areas, 
								which helped me make sense of the data beyond just raw numbers.

								<h3>Unit 7:</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I moved on to hypothesis testing. I used t-tests to compare the averages of different groups. 
								For example, with a paired t-test, I looked at the same group under two conditions 
								(like comparing two container designs), and with the independent t-test, 
								I compared two different groups (like the two diets). I also learned about 
								the F-test to check if the groups' variances were similar, which helped me 
								choose the right t-test. All of this was done in Excel, 
								and it showed me how to analyze and make decisions based on data.</p>

								<h3>Unit 8:</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								In Unit 8, I learned the basics of hypothesis testing, starting with formulating a 
								hypothesis. It's like making an educated guess—for instance, assuming that kids 
								watch TV for about 3 hours a day. 
								This assumption, known as the null hypothesis, is treated as true unless there’s strong 
								evidence to suggest otherwise.

The next step was setting up a "significance level," which is basically deciding how much evidence or 
doubt I need before rejecting my original guess. Typically, this level is set at 5%. 
I then collected data and calculated a test statistic to see how far my results were from the initial hypothesis.

Finally, I made a decision. If the calculated probability, or p-value, was less than 5%, I rejected my guess. Otherwise, I accepted it. Through this process, I learned how to test hypotheses and analyze data from samples, using statistics to make informed decisions.</p>

								<h3>Group project ( Airbnb data analysis and model creation )</h3>
							</header>
							<p>My task in this project was to perform the exploratory data analysis for New York Airbnb
								dataset
								which available on
								<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data"
									target="_blank">Kaggle</a> also you can access the code from
								<a href="Arcane_final_comb_run.html" target="_blank"> Here</a> .
							<p>
								The study developed a predictive model for Airbnb listing prices, incorporating advanced
								statistical methods to address data complexity and variability. However,
								there are notable limitations and areas for improvement. The exclusion of New York
								listings suggests
								a need for a more region-specific model, particularly for a market as dynamic as New
								York.
								Additionally, the reliance on imputation for missing data, such as the mean substitution
								for
								missing values, may introduce biases (Schafer & Graham, 2002). The models showed
								moderate
								predictive power, as indicated by MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics. Future recommendations
								include
								Region-Specific Modelling, Advanced Imputation Techniques, Diversified Data Sources and
								more Model Refinement with Feature Engineering Techniques or parameter tuning.

								<h3>Collaborative Discussion 1: The 4th Industrial Revolution</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Late in 2018, an Amazon robot in the company's warehouse in New Jersey punctured a 9oz
								can of Bear, and accordingly, 25 workers were injured among them one was in critical
								condition, the can released capsaicin to air, all the workers exposed to this gas had
								breathing problems, and burning feelings (McGregor, 2014).

								Since 2014 Amazon has been trying to implement Artificial intelligence in its recruiting
								system, the system used to discriminate between female and male, and rejecting female
								applicants or any CV that holds a "Woman" word as most of the rejected applications in
								the training dataset was for females and women related word (Dastin, 2018), the system
								was shutdown and never used in recruiting again.

								Testing the model before deploying it would save Amazon's recruiting reputation and
								Amazon's workers' Health. Taking more time in testing and applying the model to more
								testing data is crucial for the safety of the people from AI fatal mistakes.

								<h3>Collaborative Discussion Collaborative Discussion 2</h3>

							<p>In this part of the module, we discussed the evolution of AI, By 2021 when GPT was
								available at a wide range for the public so they can use it, many of the anti-AI sounds
								started to elaborate about the risks of the new technology and how risky it will be for
								humans. However, I see that AI for the last 3 years improved productivity, yes at the
								beginning ChatGPT was giving dangerous answers to some questions. Then, OpenAI started
								to put some constraints on the ChatGPT algorithm and now in 2024, less dangerous
								responses are being replied to by the ChatGPT system. Some AI researchers wanted to
								delay the AI revolution, under the claims that humanity is not ready, I see that
								humanity was not ready for anything that happened in our planet's history, but humanity
								has the ability to adapt to changes and that is how humanity will develop by adaptation,
								therefore, AI is a big leap to the future that humanity has to adapt to.
